 *
 * Note what a successful fetch does to the stand-ins the snapshot ships with:
 * it replaces them wholesale. That is the intent — the first build that finds
 * real uploads retires the hand-made tiles with nothing to remember to undo.
 * Their image files stay in `public/media/youtube/` unreferenced; they are
 * `standin-*.jpg` and safe to delete once that has happened.
 *
 * Runs as `prebuild`, which means it runs on every deploy — and which is why
 * the one rule it must never break is that it cannot fail a build. A missing
 * key, a network blip, a 403 from a quota reset: all of them leave the
 * committed snapshot exactly where it was and exit zero. The worst case is a
 * slightly stale row. See the note on failing safely below.
