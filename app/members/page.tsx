 * The last page — and it is the gate, nothing else.
 *
 * The site ends here: the landing page's one plate leads to this route, the
 * route asks for the age confirmation, and confirming leaves for OnlyFans in the
 * same tab. There is no members view behind the gate and nothing to reveal by
 * confirming, so this route holds no state at all — no stored flag, no
 * "verified" branch. The confirmation is a legal step in front of an outbound
 * link, not a key to something kept here.
 *
 * That is also why the flag is gone rather than kept for later: a stored
 * confirmation would mean a visitor who pressed Continue and then came back
 * arrived at a page with the gate already satisfied and nothing behind it — a
 * blank plate and no way forward.
 *
 * The gate is a full-bleed panel rather than a modal over the landing page,
 * because arriving here is a deliberate step, not an interruption. The plate
 * behind it is the same still the landing page uses for this section, so
 * following the link feels like walking into the picture that was just tapped.
