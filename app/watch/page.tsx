 * proportions match. That button sits on a photograph and needs the devices

 * picture under it is decoration. Same size and weight, fewer tricks.

 * Paper. `body` is ink globally, so the ground is set here, on the page,
 * following the pattern `/members` established — and paper is the right ground
 * for a wall of thumbnails, which need a quiet field behind them rather than
 * the ink the reading pages use.
 *
 * `Header` is not used. It is the landing page's furniture: fixed over
 * full-bleed footage, blended against it, dropping in on a `ready` flag handed
 * down from the loader. None of that applies here. `/members` and the shell the
 * legitimacy pages share both show what a standalone route does instead, which
 * is to place the mark itself and scroll like an ordinary document.
 *
 * No age gate. This is public YouTube content and gating it would misrepresent
 * what it is.
