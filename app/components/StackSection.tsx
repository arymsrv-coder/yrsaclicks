/**
 * The plate's button.
 *
 * A filled button, not an outline. The outlined version was legible only once
 * you found it — it read as a border drawn over a photo until you hovered, and
 * on touch there is no hover at all.
 *
 * Brass, not ink. Ink was the same green as the panel that had just opened and
 * as the header mark, so on a pale plate the button read as more of the
 * furniture. Brass is the one warm colour in the system and the only thing on a
 * plate wearing it, which is what makes it the thing to press. Hover deepens
 * rather than lightens — see --color-brass-deep for why that direction is the
 * only one available.
 *
 * The box grew faster than the label: roughly a third more padding against a
 * couple of points of type, because what was wanted was presence rather than a
 * louder word. Radius is up from 6px — softened further, still not a pill; a
 * fully round end would read as a web button rather than a plate. The bone
 * outline is what lifts the fill off the photograph.
 *
 * A module constant because two elements wear it: an internal route renders as
 * a `Link` and an off-site destination as a plain anchor, and the two must be
 * indistinguishable. Colours live in classes, not inline styles, so the hover
 * fill can actually override them.
