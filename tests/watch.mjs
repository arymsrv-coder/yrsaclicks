/**
 * Guards the landing page's channel section: the two rows, and the one
 * decision the section's usability
 * rests on — that no YouTube player exists until a tile is clicked.
 *
 * Two modes, because the committed snapshot can legitimately be empty (it was
 * when this was written — the channel had no public uploads):
 *
 *   node tests/watch.mjs             assert whatever the snapshot produces,
 *                                    plus the checks that need no browser
 *   node tests/watch.mjs --fixture   swap in fixture data, rebuild, assert the
 *                                    rows and the player, then restore
 *
 * Fixture mode is the one that proves the rows work. Without it an empty
 * snapshot makes every row assertion pass by never running, which is worse than
 * no test at all.
 *
 * Fixture mode leaves `out/` holding the fixture build — rerun `npm run build`
 * afterwards before trusting the export.
 *
 * Run against a built export:
 *   npm run build && node tests/watch.mjs
